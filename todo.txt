I think I'll write up dates to note how far my data has come now.

Registration works. It required the initial database.db file to be deleted because it was made with the now-gone "user" model. Login is not working for some odd reason. When I click on login, the issue is that the submit button isn't doing anything.

Login works completely. The values selected in the html page weren't "student" and "admin" like they should be, but instead "option1" and "option2". That had to be changed.
TODO (DONE):
Touch up the home screen of the website before Miss would dare take a look at mine lol.

Front page of SCAS looks more presentable, registration works, login works for both student and admin, redirecting is about to be tested. New module postlogin_views is about to be tested. I'm somewhat pleased so far.

Since last log, there has been an issue where the login wouldn't truly register. This issue has just been fixed now. That's brilliant.

It has come to my attention that the log from three days ago was a lie. @login_required is currently my biggest nightmare.
