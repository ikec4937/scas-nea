I think I'll write up dates to note how far my data has come now.

Registration works. It required the initial database.db file to be deleted because it was made with the now-gone "user" model. Login is not working for some odd reason. When I click on login, the issue is that the submit button isn't doing anything.

TODO:
Touch up the home screen of the website before Miss would dare take a look at mine lol.
